# 🌍 ESG Intelligence Platform

**Verifiable Supply Chain Transparency with Blockchain + AI**

## 📌 Overview

The **ESG Intelligence Platform** is a hybrid framework that combines **blockchain anchoring**, **verifiable credentials (vLEI)**, and **AI-driven analytics** to deliver **real-time, zero-trust ESG intelligence**. It ensures end-to-end **supply chain transparency**, **cryptographic compliance verification**, and **multi-tier ESG risk insights** for enterprises, regulators, and stakeholders.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **🔒 Zero-Trust Verification** – Cryptographic proofs + vLEI for authentic ESG data
* **📊 Real-Time Analytics** – AI/LLM-powered ESG insights & compliance checks
* **🌐 Supply Chain Transparency** – 94%+ multi-tier visibility across supplier networks
* **⚡ High Performance** – 1,247 data points/sec throughput, 142ms average verification
* **📈 Automated Reporting** – Regulatory-ready ESG reports with immutable audit trails
